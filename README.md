## Description

A precursor to the PacMen Exercise, this project - PacMan Solo - is a simulation of a single PacMan traveling across the page from left to right, in a characteristic way of chomping as he goes. There's a hidden nuance in the simulation... if you double-click PacMan, he seems to speed up a little, but then resumes his original pace.

## How to Run

- Download the repository on your machine as a zip file.
- Unzip the file.
- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- PacMan will begin moving across the page from left to right, and will return when he reaches the edge.
- View and enjoy.

You can also see a working demo <a href="https://lkmitx.github.io/pacman-solo/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Further development of this repository could include the following:

- [ ] Allow user to start and pause PacMan's movement.
- [ ] Allow user to reset and return PacMan to the starting point.
- [ ] Add dynamic boundary updating so that the user can resize their browser window and PacMan will use updated edges for reverse motion.
